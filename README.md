# Description

An application programming interface (API) is a way for two or more computer programs to communicate with each other. It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software.[1] A document or standard that describes how to build or use such a connection or interface is called an API specification. A computer system that meets this standard is said to implement or expose an API. The term API may refer either to the specification or to the implementation. Whereas a system's user interface dictates how its end-users interact with the system in question, its API dictates how to write code that takes advantage of that system's capabilities.

In contrast to a user interface, which connects a computer to a person, an application programming interface connects computers or pieces of software to each other. It is not intended to be used directly by a person (the end user) other than a computer programmer who is incorporating it into the software. An API is often made up of different parts which act as tools or services that are available to the programmer. A program or a programmer that uses one of these parts is said to call that portion of the API. The calls that make up the API are also known as subroutines, methods, requests, or endpoints. An API specification defines these calls, meaning that it explains how to use or implement them.

# Task

Build an API backend using any framework you want to use.

Features of your project:

User authentification in order to administer the data

User Token (OAuth)

Get/Post/Update/Destroy on your topic -- Get must be accessible without being connected

Get will provide pagination (max 20 elements per page)

Cache (redis)

(Optional) A Graphql interface

Documentation, but you can use swagger on your API. Example

A postman Documentation (and you will provide the link inside your readme)

# Usage

Your project must be hosted in the cloud. (AWS/Google Cloud/Azure/IBM) Each of these providers have a free tier. You should be able to host it for 0$. :)

You will provide the URL of your project inside the README
